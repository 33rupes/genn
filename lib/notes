in order to change between INDIVIDUALID and INDIVIDUALG connections, one needs to consider:

change the definition in the model definition (modelDefinition.cc)
change/ add a global conductance to be set for INDIVIDUALID
provide the right type of connectivity array, i.e., in the current hackky version load a float* from disk (INDIVIDUALG) or read a unsigned int* from disk (INDIVIDUALID) within map_classol (!).

notes on delay implementation (24-10-2014)
- circular spike queues are defined for spike events (not true spikes)
- there is a fixed number of delay slots (in time steps)


for future Brian interface:
- allow time delay queue granularity to differ from single time steps
- could write preprocessing software to analyse delay distributions and define delayslots and time granularity of the delay slots automatically
