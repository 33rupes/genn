
  Time-step dependency of the locust olfactory system (Nowotny et al. 2005)
  =============================================

This is the same model as the other MBody1 examples, which makes it possible to
freeze the Poisson input to the values generated by a small timestep, in order to 
inject it to the network by pooling together the spikes in the intermediary time steps 
if DT is higher.

Model files classol_sim.cu, MBody1.cc and map_classol.cc are different when creating and 
injecting the PN spikes. 

To set them to create spikes, navigate to ./model and call

./makelinks.h C

You may want to copy the output directory manually after this step.

To set them to inject spikes, navigate to ./model and call

./makelinks.h R

The rest is same as for the other MBody1 examples, as explained below. Don't forget to
set the last argument when calling generate_run to 1 to use the same setup if you 
want to compare. Alternatively, you can use MBody_dt_runall.sh, which executes and
copies a number of trials with different time steps.
 
This example project contains a helper executable called "generate_run", which also
prepares additional synapse connectivity and input pattern data, before compiling and
executing the model. To compile it, simply type:
  nmake /f WINmakefile
for Windows users, or:
  make
for Linux, Mac and other UNIX users. 


  USAGE
  -----

  ./generate_run <0(CPU)/1(GPU)> <nAL> <nKC> <nLH> <nDN> <gscale> <DIR> <MODEL> <DEBUG 0(OFF)/1(ON)> <ftype DOUBLE/FLOAT> <reuse input&connectivity? 0(no)/1(yes)>

An example invocation of generate_run is:

  ./generate_run 1 100 1000 20 100 0.0025 outname MBody1 0 FLOAT 0

Such a command would generate a locust olfaction model with 100 antennal lobe neurons,
1000 mushroom body Kenyon cells, 20 lateral horn interneurons and 100 mushroom body
output neurons, and launch a simulation of it on a CUDA-enabled GPU using single precision floating point numbers. 
All output files will be prefixed with "outname" and will be created under the "outname" directory.

In more details, what generate_run program does is: 
a) use some other tools to generate the appropriate connectivity
   matrices and store them in files.

b) build the source code for the model by writing neuron numbers into
   userproject/include/sizes.h, and executing "buildmodel.sh MBody1 [DEBUG OFF/ON]".  

c) compile the generated code by invoking "make clean && make" 
   running the code, e.g. "./classol_sim r1 1".
